In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines


So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine


We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
